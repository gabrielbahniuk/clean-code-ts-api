## [**Link to the complete course**](https://www.udemy.com/course/tdd-com-mango/?referralCode=B53CE5CA2B9AFA5A6FA1)

This API is part of professor Rodrigo Manguinho's training on Udemy.

It aims to show how to create an API with a well defined architecture and decoupled architecture, using TDD (Test-driven Development) as development metodology,
Clean Architecture to distribute responsibility in layers, always following SOLID principles and whenever possible, applying Design Patterns to solve some common issues.
